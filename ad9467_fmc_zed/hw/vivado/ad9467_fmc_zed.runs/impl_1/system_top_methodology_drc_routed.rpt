PDRC-190#1 Warning
Suboptimally placed synchronized register chain  
The FDRE cell i_system_wrapper/system_i/axi_ad9467_dma/inst/i_request_arb/i_sync_control_src/cdc_sync_stage2_reg[0] in site SLICE_X30Y64 is part of a synchronized register chain that is suboptimally placed as the load FDRE cell i_system_wrapper/system_i/axi_ad9467_dma/inst/i_request_arb/i_sync_status_src/cdc_sync_stage1_reg[1] is not placed in the same (SLICE) site.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock i_system_wrapper/system_i/sys_audio_clkgen/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_1 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and mmcm_clk_0_s are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks mmcm_clk_0_s]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks mmcm_clk_0_s and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks mmcm_clk_0_s] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and mmcm_clk_0_s are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks mmcm_clk_0_s]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Warning
No common node between related clocks

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-10#1 Warning
Missing property on synchronizer  
One or more logic synchronizer has been detected between 2 clock domains but the synchronizer does not have the property ASYNC_REG defined on one or both registers. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
